# Instant-Xordle
A spinoff of Xordle (original by @Keldor) in which you guess the two secrets on the first turn.

This spinoff is (at the time of writing) still only a prototype/proof-of-concept. Things to add in future include:
- Daily mode
- Popup menus such as settings, help, and stats
- The ability to export a tile grid after a game in order to share your game result with the whole world

These features should all *hopefully* be added by sometime around 07/06/2022, at which point the project will reach a full release :)
